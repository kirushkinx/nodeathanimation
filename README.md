# No Death Animations

This plugin does not have any setting to enable to disable it for a specific player.

## Explanation

On mctiers.com there's a bug that might've turned into a feature, the death animation not showing.
When stripping health information from a player / entity, mctiers.com might not have checked if the entity is dead.
Once the entity is dead the client wouldn't know about it and won't show the death animation.
